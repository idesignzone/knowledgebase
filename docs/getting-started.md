## What is Gridbox

Gridbox is a headless Wordpress website builder that makes use of [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/ "WordPress") and its default [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/ "Gutenberg") editor to create and manage your website content and display in a [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/ "Gridsome") website.
